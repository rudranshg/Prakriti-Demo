# PRAKRITI
We live in a home shared by 7.125 billions of humans and even more plants and animals. But ever since human civilisation flourished on Earth, we have been using our resources blindly, not even thinking about others with whom we share this earth, neither we think about our coming generations. In our selfishness, we have been digging our own graves. But today, even after knowing the truth, most of us have are ignoring it and still continue to use our resources unjustly and keep destroying and polluting our home. It's time that we start doing something now, so that tomorrow we find ourselves living in a much better world which believes in sustainable development and lives in harmony with it's environment.

Prakriti is an IIT Kanpur student initiative aimed at tackling problems which result in misuse of natural resources, causes pollution and harms our bio-diversity. Join us in our quest to realise a world where we will be living in harmony with our environment which.
