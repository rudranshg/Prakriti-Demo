                    <blockquote><b>"AT FIRST, I THOUGHT I WAS FIGHTING TO SAVE RUBBER TREES, AND THEN I THOUGHT I 
                        WAS FIGHTING TO SAVE AMAZON. NOW I REALIZE I AM FIGHTING FOR HUMANITY."<br> 
                         - Chico Mendes</b></blockquote>
                    <p>Buxwaha forest lies in the Chhatarpur district in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya
                        Pradesh, about 260 km northeast of the state capital Bhopal. Recently, Aditya Birla
                        Group's Essel Mining & Industries Limited won a bid for the block used for diamond
                        mining. A forest habitat and over two lakh trees might be cleared for the proposed
                        bunder diamond mining project of 364 hectares in the buxwaha forest.</p>

                    <p>It is home to several species of flora and fauna. The tree varieties found in the area are Khair,
                        bel, dhava, ghost, and manymore, and animal species such as Indian Gazelle, Chowsingha,
                        Leopard, Indian Rumped vultures are under threat the proposed project. It also shelters
                        trees with medicinal benefits like Teak, Ken, Behda, Banyan, Jamun Tendu, Khair, Bel,
                        Dhava, Seja, Ghoat, Renjha, Amltas, Saugon, etc.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, the forest safeguards more than 8000 tribal communities which depend on
                        forest resources for their livelihood. The project faces resistance due to ecological
                        concerns, and despite the claims to provide jobs in mining, locals feel that they will lose
                        livelihood options due to the project. The project will need 5.9 million cubic meters of
                        water per day for operating the plant and proposes to divert a seasonal stream for it by
                        building a dam.</p>

                    <p>The local community fears that mining will further threaten the water
                        security of Buxwaha, a water-stressed region. The Bunder mining project falls in the
                        Bundelkhand region of India, which is a water-scarce area. Environmentalists believe
                        that the considerable water requirement for diamond mining would add to the region's
                        water woes.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rio Tinto's Exit</h2>

                    <p>After Rio Tinto's exit, they felt that they had protected the Buxwaha forest from
                        destruction, but now they might have to lose their homeland after second bidding.
                        Locals suspect the agencies are hiding the facts about the number of trees supposed
                        to be cut. They presume it is not just 2,15,000 trees but is over 5,00,000 trees will fall
                        for the projection, but the forest is still under threat.</p>

                    <p>The Ken-Betwa River Interlinking
                        project already endangers 23 lakh trees, and 1.9 lakh trees have already been cut
                        down for Bundelkhand Expressway Highway.
                    </p>

                    <p>The forest ecosystem will be remarkably damaged due to habitat destruction, man-animal conflict,
                        and infrastructure in the environmentally sensitive region. The
                        destruction of flora, megafauna (tiger), and human socio-ecological domain done so
                        blatantly and 'legally' shows that it is never about nature or the people. Nobody in
                        power cares about this in present-day India.
                    </p>

                    <p>Initially, only 154.79 acres of the land were accorded mining permissions by the
                        government, but later the mining venture began demanding about 383 hectares of
                        forest land. It proposes to use this forest land to scrap the debris generated, which
                        would render the forest ecosystem. This diamond mining will not only clear a large
                        region of forest, leading to loss of biodiversity but will also stress the water resources of
                        an area that already faces water scarcity. This clearing would render the forest
                        inaccessible and pollute the region, thus wreaking havoc on the forest ecosystem. </p>

                    <p>Mining and similar human activities in sensitive areas lead to the ecological and
                        geographical disparity. This disparity becomes the reason for natural calamities such as
                        earthquakes, droughts, floods, etc. The facts are saddening and alarming at the same
                        time when the world is already facing drastic consequences of human interventions with
                        nature in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Government's Response</h2>
                    <p>On the other hand, the government has condemned the opposing voices by saying it
                        will bring development, and they will plant a sapling in compensation for the chopped
                        trees. However, numerous researchers and empirical evidence point out that damage
                        to a naturally grown forest is irreparable and can't be compensated by increasing the
                        trees elsewhere because these trees will take decades to rejuvenate into a forest, and
                        tribals and animals will have nowhere to go.
                    </p>

                        OUR FOREFATHERS, BUT ON LOAN FROM OUR CHILDREN, SO WE HAVE TO HAND OVER 
                        TO THEM AS IT WAS HANDED TO US.‚Äù<br>
                         - Mahatma Gandhi</b></blockquote>
                    <p>COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to stop for a moment and think. Think about our 
                        actions. Think about the repercussions of interfering with nature and destroying the 
                        green cover at the expense of diamonds, especially when oxygen scarcity had rattled 
                        the nation amid the COVID-19 pandemic, where thousands died due to the 
                        unavailability of oxygen.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, it becomes imperative for us to reassess the idea of development at the cost of 
                        destruction. The implementation of the Bunder Mining Project will surely surge the 
                        exports of the diamond rather than importing them, thereby increasing the country's 
                        GDP. And the project will also steer the development and upliftment of the erstwhile 
                        primitive region.
                    </p>
                    <p> But the question is whether it is this type of development that we 
                        want? The one at the cost of lakh of trees, millions of gallons of water, and unique
                        species of the natural world can never be reinstalled through afforestation programs 
                        under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016? The tribals who lodge in these 
                        forests for their livelihoods are the most affected communities. They are assured proper
                        rehabilitation with requisite compensation. But how beneficial is it for them in the long 
                        term? Is it moral to mine diamonds worth billions for development but at the cost of 
                        priceless forests, wildlife, and tribals?
                    </p>
                    <p>It's high time that we consider the idea of development. The preferable way forward for 
                        the same is for all the stakeholders to sit together at the decision-making tables, leading 
                        to holistic planning, execution, feedback of such projects, and shaping a brighter future.
